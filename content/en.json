    "about_text": "I am a student at SGGW, Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, specializing in cloud technologies. I am working on speech generation systems and their integration with RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) as part of my engineering thesis. I am interested in ML — especially Computer Vision (YOLO det, YOLO pose), audio processing, and Text-to-Speech. I also have experience developing web applications. As a hobby, I work with audio production: I record and mix tracks in Reaper DAW, and I also do mastering. I use tools like UVR (Universal Vocal Removal) for vocal separation — I often record amateur covers to practice mixing vocals for non-professional singers.",
