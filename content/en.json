  "about_title": "About Me",
  "about_text": "I am a student at WZIM SGGW, majoring in Cloud Technologies. I work on speech generation systems and their integration with RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion). My interests lie in practical ML applications — especially Computer Vision (YOLO detection, YOLO pose), audio processing and Text-to-Speech. I also have experience creating web applications: frontend with Angular and backend with Django. As a hobby, I produce and mix audio: I record and mix multi-instrument tracks and vocals in Reaper and perform mastering. I also use tools like UVR (Universal Vocal Removal) for voice separation — I often record amateur vocal covers to practice vocal mixing of non-professional voices.",
